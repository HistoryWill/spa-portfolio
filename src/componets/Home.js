          <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>Hello there! Thank you for dropping by my new dumpy website. I've always had problems completing projects and making sure I can actually produce deliverables. So I decided to make a site that would both be a project but also necessitate that I continuously update it and other projects. In a sense I hope to chain myself to this site as a way to prevent the project abandonment issues caused by all the moral failings of my generations. I hope it works.</p>

  <p>In general I plan on including a project status section. A blog that will include posts relating to my experience of trying to figure out what this whole computer business is about, my thoughts on topics that interest me, reviews of media that I like, and finally any other miscellaneous things that are cool. </p>
