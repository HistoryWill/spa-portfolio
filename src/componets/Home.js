  <p>Hello there! Thank you for dropping by my new website. I've always had problems completing projects and making sure I can actually produce deliverables. So I decided to make a site that would both be a project but also necessitate that I continuously update it and other projects. In a sense I hope to chain myself to this site as a way to prevent the project abandonment issues caused by all the moral failings of my generations. I hope it works.</p>
